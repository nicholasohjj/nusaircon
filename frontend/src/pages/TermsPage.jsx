          EVS Electricity Top-Up Bot · Last updated: June 2026
        </p>
        <Para>
          Please read these Terms carefully before using the EVS Electricity
          Top-Up Bot and web app ("the Service"). By using the Service, you
          agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the
          Service.
        </Para>
      </div>

      <Section id="s1" title="1. Service overview">
        <Para>
          The Service is an unofficial, independently developed tool that
          enables NUS hostel residents to check their EVS electricity meter
          balance and top up their meters via credit card through Telegram or the
          standalone web app. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or
          operated by NUS, EVS, eNETS, or any payment network.
        </Para>
      </Section>

      <Section id="s2" title="2. Eligibility">
        <Para>You may use the Service only if you:</Para>
        <Ul
          items={[
            "Are a current resident of a supported NUS hostel (PGPR, Houses @ PGP, Residential Colleges, NUS College, UTown Residence, or RVRC);",
            "Hold a valid EVS electricity meter registered to your hostel unit; and",
            "Are authorised to make payments for that meter.",
          ]}
        />
      </Section>

      <Section id="s3" title="3. Payment terms">
        <Para>
          <strong>Top-up amounts</strong> are subject to a minimum of SGD $6.00
          and a maximum of SGD $50.00 per transaction.
        </Para>
        <Para>
          <strong>Card payments</strong> are processed through eNETS. By
          initiating a payment, you authorise the charge to your credit card and
          agree to eNETS' payment terms and conditions.
        </Para>
        <Para>
          <strong>No refunds</strong> are guaranteed through this Service. Once
          a top-up is successfully submitted to the EVS system, it cannot be
          reversed through this service. For disputes, contact EVS or your card
          issuer directly.
        </Para>
        <SubHeading>Failed transactions.</SubHeading>
        <Para>
          If a payment is declined or the process fails partway through, a
          charge may not be applied. However, some card issuers may place a
          temporary pre-authorisation hold even when a transaction does not
          complete. In the event of any technical failure mid-flow, verify the
          outcome with your card issuer and EVS before retrying.
        </Para>
        <SubHeading>Session expiry during payment.</SubHeading>
        <Para>
          Payment and result pages use time-limited encrypted tokens. A pending
          payment token expires after approximately 10 minutes, and a completed
          result token expires after approximately 24 hours. If a token expires,
          a result page becomes inaccessible, a receipt link may be unavailable,
          or a third-party EVS/eNETS session may no longer be usable. If you do
          not receive a confirmation through the Service or your card issuer,
          verify the outcome directly with your card issuer and EVS before
          retrying, to avoid being charged twice.
        </Para>
        <SubHeading>Top-up not reflected on meter.</SubHeading>
        <Para>
          If your payment is confirmed by your card issuer but the top-up does
          not appear on your meter, the Service operator has no ability to
          investigate or resolve this. You must contact EVS directly with your
          transaction reference number. Do not retry the payment until the
          original transaction has been clarified, to avoid being charged twice.
        </Para>
        <SubHeading>
          Electricity or air conditioning not functioning after top-up.
        </SubHeading>
        <Para>
          The Service is solely a payment interface. It has no control over
          meter activation, electricity delivery, air conditioning operation, or
          any hostel infrastructure. If your electricity or air conditioning
          does not function after a successful top-up, contact your hostel
          management office or EVS directly. This is entirely outside the scope
          of this service and the Service operator bears no responsibility.
        </Para>
      </Section>

      <Section id="s4" title="4. Card security">
        <Para>
          Your card details are <strong>RSA-encrypted in your browser</strong>{" "}
          before transmission. The Service's server never receives or stores
          your plaintext card number or CVV. Despite this, you use this service
          at your own risk. We make no warranties about the security of
          third-party systems (eNETS, EVS) involved in processing your payment.

      <Section id="s5" title="5. Meter identity and system routing">
        <Para>
          You are responsible for entering the correct 8-digit meter ID. Topping
          up the wrong meter is your sole responsibility. The Service includes a
          cross-system guard for cp2nus users that rejects meters belonging to
          the cp2 system before payment is initiated, but this check is not
          infallible. If you are unsure which system your meter belongs to,
          verify with your hostel management.
        </Para>
        <SubHeading>Meter ID not found.</SubHeading>
        <Para>
          If your meter ID cannot be located in the EVS system, the Service will
          not be able to proceed with a top-up. This may occur for newly
          assigned units, recently transferred residents, or due to delays in
          the EVS system. Verify your meter ID with your hostel management
          office before retrying. The Service operator cannot manually look up,
          register, or resolve meter ID issues on your behalf.

          not guarantee uninterrupted service, accurate balance data, or
